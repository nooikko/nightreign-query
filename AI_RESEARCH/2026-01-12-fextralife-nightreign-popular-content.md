## Key Takeaways

1. **Classes/Nightfarers are the #1 entry point** - Every class has dedicated wiki page + guide, indicating highest user interest
2. **Meta & tier lists drive significant traffic** - Multiple external sites tracking rankings suggests high search volume
3. **Boss content is evergreen** - 50+ bosses with individual strategies = sustained long-tail traffic
4. **Beginner content remains crucial** - Multiple official and community guides indicate consistent new player onboarding
5. **Legendary weapons are high-value targets** - Limited quantity (26) with specific acquisition methods drives focused searches
6. **Meta-progression (Relics/Vessels) is unique to Nightreign** - Differentiates from base Elden Ring, likely high interest
7. **Bleed builds dominate meta** - Executor class + bleed weapons consistently top-tier since launch
8. **Interactive map is core utility** - Two map variants with location markers essential for exploration
9. **DLC content represents latest engagement spike** - Forsaken Hollows (Dec 2025) likely driving current traffic
10. **No public traffic analytics available** - Fextralife does not publish page view statistics or visitor counts

## Gaps Identified

1. **No direct page view analytics** - Fextralife does not make traffic data public
2. **No "Most Visited" section** - Wiki lacks built-in popularity indicators
3. **No view count badges** - Individual pages don't display visitor metrics
4. **Limited trending indicators** - Cannot definitively rank pages by actual traffic

## Recommendations for Next Steps

**For Query System Implementation:**
- Prioritize query patterns around: class selection, boss strategies, legendary weapon locations, meta builds, beginner tips
- Structure database to handle: character stats, weapon properties, boss resistances, relic effects, skill descriptions
- Consider tier list integration for dynamic meta tracking
- Build semantic understanding of build optimization queries (stat scaling, passive effects, synergies)

**For Content Prioritization:**
- Focus initial data ingestion on Tier 1 content (classes, bosses, weapons, progression)
- Secondary priority: meta-progression systems (relics, vessels), multiplayer mechanics
- Tertiary: lore, achievements, cosmetics

**For User Intent Mapping:**
- New players → beginner guides, class selection, basic mechanics
- Optimization seekers → tier lists, legendary weapons, meta builds
- Completionists → boss lists, achievement guides, quest lines
- Build crafters → weapon scaling, stat optimization, relic synergies
